This case need to be tested on both RWO/RWX volumes

1. Create a PVC with size larger than 8589934591 GiB.
    - Deployment keep in pending status, RWO/RWX volume will keep in a create -> delete loop.
2. Create a PVC with size <= 8589934591 GiB, but greater than the actual available space size.
    - RWO/RWX volume will be created, and volume will have annotation "longhorn.io/volume-scheduling-error": "insufficient storage volume scheduling failure" in it.
3. Create a PVC with size < the actual available space sizeï¼ŒResize the PVC to a not schedulable size
    - After resize PVC to a not schedulable size, both RWO/RWX were still in scheduling status.

We can modify/use https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longhorn/longhorn/master/examples/rwx/rwx-nginx-deployment.yaml to deploy RWO/RWX PVC for this test
